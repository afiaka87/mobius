# backend

This folder contains the "backend" of the project. This may betray typical usage of backend a bit, as we are also calling various API's in the backend here. API's include weather services, OpenAI DALLE, GPT4, and more. We also may run various models in the backend, such as SDXL, AnimateDiff, SDXL-Turbo, etc. These can be local, remote or cloud-based models.

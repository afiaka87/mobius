# comfy_workloads

Folder contains various ComfyUI "workloads" in their json format. These workloads are used to generate a DAG for the ComfyUI server to run various model inference tasks including SDXL, AnimateDiff, SDXL-Turbo, etc. 

Make sure you have the ComfyUI server running and that all the necessary model weights have been downloaded. This can be achieved simply by dragging each json into the ComfyUI interface, attempting to run it and resolving any missing dependencies/weights as they arise.
